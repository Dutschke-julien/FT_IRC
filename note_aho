note to myself :
JOIN : It still need to be finished, it don't reply the topic nor the welcome's message to the clients
    this feature need to be added to the switch case 2, and for both of the channel creation.
    numeric error need to be check when everything is connected.

topic : the iss's split is wrong, it should be split first at the :, verify if there a topic, then get the channel if there is any.
    the rest should work even with the modification.

TODO NEXT :
    more information about the modes is needed, then implemented in join and topic before further advancement.
    it will be easier to add functions related to mode.
